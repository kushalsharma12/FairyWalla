## The problem it solves

Suppose you are sitting at home and a fairywalla is out there, asking you to buy things 
and your parents said check who is out and see what products he had.
This is the process of buying things from fairywallas, till now.
You don't know, that any fairywalla is coming or not untill you watch out in your area
if he is there or not.
You don't know, what products they have untill you go near to them and see what they have
for you.

## So, Problem is ü•Å
Today we are living in a world where each and everything is based on technology and same happening with Fairywallas, as they have really good products to sell but due this technological shift they can't adpt which affects their living. 
So, the only way to solve this problem is to ride those fairywalla in the boat of technology.  We are doing this with the helps of two apps i.e Fairywalla App and FairyUser App.

can track every fairywalla which they had requested to come at ther location with Google Maps.

FairyUser App
By this app fairywalla will be able to get location of the user. Fairy walla will be able to check the 
products he sell, can update and delete his products. Fairywalla will get the location of the user whenever the user ping him to come at user's location.
